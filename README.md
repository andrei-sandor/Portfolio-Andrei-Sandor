  Created in a team of 6 a website (frontend/backend) for a fictual museum that has a manager, employees and visitors. All employees of the museum will be able to move artifacts around from one room to another. Customers will be able to view artifacts on display, make loan requests, and donate new artifacts to the museum. The museum owner will be able to perform any employee action, but will also be able to perform additional administrative tasks.
  
This website was broken into 3 sprints. The first sprint was used to setup the backend from a non technical point of view (requirements, use case diagrams and domain model). Persistence layer was also done. Then, the second sprint, we implemented the backend by using a database (postgreSQL) and JPA annotations. The backend was broken into service, DTOs and controllers. The backend was tested (unit and integration testing) with Postman by using JSON files. Then, for the final sprint, we created the fontend by using Vue.js. We also learned project management techniques used in the industry like GitHub projects, issues, sprints meetings and sprint reviews.

Games can be added to a user's list which can create his list. There is also a functionality to select games with a price threshold. The games' stores can be added to the website and edited.
  
  This project was broken into two sprints. The first sprint was about creating the backend by using Java, Gradle, Controllers, DTOs, model, repository, service from a domain model. Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to write user stories for what we implemented by automating them with Gherkin step definitions. Then, for the second sprint, we implementent the frontend by using Vue.js (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, axios, router, store and views). Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to test the frontend. For this project, we applied software development management techniques such as sprints, backlogs, burndown charts, scrum masters, product owners, story points, sprint reviews, sprint meetings.

Visitors of the island can register as a member sand book dive guides, equipment and hotels. There is an administrator that can handle the website. He will deal with the inventory and the dive guides.

There was a domain model that was first created to respect the requirements of the administrator of the diving program. Then, this domain model was translated into UMPLE code. Domain constraints were included. For the second sprint, we implemented completely a feature of the application.  A controller and Gherkin step definitions were done by doing Javadoc documentation. For the third sprint, we continued to build the application by introducing state machines. Finally, for the last sprint, we implemented the frontend by using Javafx and CSS. First university project where we add to work in teams.

## Team Out of School Projects

### TransportHacks (Fall 2023 and Winner of the Best Sustainability Hack)
#### Co-Ride | Easy Ride Sharing!

- Created in a team of 4 an application that takes a person efficently from point A to point B while also predicting maintenance for a car by matching to a driver that goes through that path .
- Developed the backend by creating three Machine Learning algorithms that are deployed via FastAPI in Microsoft Azure.
- The frontend was created by using React and Google tools.

Tools:
- Python (Pandas and Scikit-Learn)
- Machine Learning (regression + metrics from scklearn).
- FastApi, Google Cloud and MS Azure
- React (TypeScript, JS and CSS)
- SQL db
- Streamlit
- GoDaddy
- Google Geolocation API and Directions API 

The website has a login page and sign up page for users of the website. There is also a dark and white theme for this app. Then, there will be a page with the commuting preferences. There, you can choose if you are a driver or commuter. If you are a driver, you can select the start and end position of commute. We can also check the maintenance that comes from the machine learning algorithm. Then, the road will be shown on the map from Google. If you are a commuter, you can input your start and end position. Then, when going to the matches tab, you will get best matching drivers that will go by where they go. The maintenance cost will be shown in case if something happened. For the backend, we can predict the engine condition in function of many parameters. We can predict the maintenance costs if they will happen. Finally, we can predict the best driver for a user in function of his/her position.

For the backend (find the best match, the state of the engine and the maintenance), Jupyter Notebook files have been created first where we determine the best regression algorithm  (by using metrics) with the help of ML Python libraries. For these models, the csv files have been replaced by a SQL databse. Then, to link it to the frontend, we used FastApi which takes the models and create endpoints on them. Then, when those endpoints were ready, they were deployed via Google Cloud and MS Azure. Then, the frontent was done with NextJS that put all the UX/UI together. NextAuth for authentication, Google Geolocation and Directions API were used to intelligently translate input coordinates and display the directions between the two points.

### TOHacks (Summer 2022)
#### ChatMoji 

- Created in a team of 4 an application that takes speach as input and convets it to text with emojis.
- Developed a backend in Python by using speach libraries and the frontend by using the Flask framework.
  
Tools:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- audioop
- websockets
- asyncio



This application was built by bracking it in many Python files. We add a file that deals with the history of the chat, that connects the input to the app, that records message, that sends messages by using websockets, audioop and pyaudio libraires. We had another file that deals with receiving the message. We had an algorithm that converts text to an emoji based on extracting features from the input with simple strings attributes. We also had an app that connects, listens and saves the message on a specific port to use for the frontend. We added another file that connects to a server for future development on the app. In order to collect the users audio input we used the pyaudio and to process the audio we used the AIservice assembly AI that the sponsers of the TOHackaton provided to us. Furthermore, a complete and complex CSS file was produced to come with the HTML file that as a place to record the message and a box to output the message. There is also a page where you can login and logout.

### RUHackathon (Summer 2022)
#### CureSoft
Tools:
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Sklearn (LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB)
- SQlite

Created in a teams of 3 for the RUHackathon an application that takes as input medical messurements and predicts whether the person has a disease like heart diseases, diabetes and liver diseases. The user can access throught the command line the account and they can select which disease they want to be tested. There is a complex process to handle the data. Also, there is like an admin/doctor that can see the results and register the patient. There is functionality to handle the login. 

To predict the disease, machine learning and simple Python logic was used to produce this project. For the machine learning model, RandomForestClassifier was used on 80/20 startegy on data This work was then integrated with a login.py file that deals with taking the inputs, calling the algorithms mentioned previously and producing the outputs. There is also a functionality to login, to logout and to use the application (enter input and have access to previous inputs/history) by using a sqlite database.

## Individual Out of School Projects
### Student Predictor (Fall 2023)
Tools:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Imbalanced Techniques, Train test split, classfication report, R2Score, metrics for regression)
- EDA
- Flask
- HTML and CSS
- Pickle
- Jupyter Notebook

Created alone a Flask web app. This app called student predictor is a fundamental tool for university students. The first thing that it can do is to predict the grade of a student in function of many parameters for a midterms and final exam. With the current situation, students want to know if they have Covid. I used a dataset from Kindle that checks many symptoms to predict if the student has Covid. Furthermore, a student wants to enjoy his/her free time, that's why I included a machine learning alogirthm to predict if a movie is good or not. Finally, students want to optimize their presence to school by knowing the weather. I created an algorithm that predicts the weather in function of temperature, precipitations and wind.

To create this app, this is what I have done. First of all, I used datasets from Kindle about exams, Covid, wheather and IMDB of movies. Then, I used to csv files inside a Jupyter Notebook. Then, I cleaned the datasets by doing EDA, dealing with outliers and factorizing. Then, I investigate the machine learning algorithm. I investigate regression algorithms (Linear Regression, MLPRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor and SVC. Then, I used r2_score, MAE and MSE to determine the best algorithm by doing 80/20. Then, I also investigated classifiaction algorithms (GaussianNB, KNN and DecisionTreeClassfier) by using a classification report. Then, I kept everything up to and including the fit inside a Python file that will generate a pickle file. Then, I started the Flask part. I first created the frontend by using HTML (Dropdown lists,inputs and titles) and the CSS for colors. Then, I linked the frontend to the backend with Flask. I used the inputs of the frontend by linking them to the backend by using the pickle files that serialize the Machine Learning model. An endpoint has been created to handle all at once all the results.

To use the app:
Go to the main folder and run the command

    python app.py

Go to the localhost mentioned and input some values. After, click predict and you can see the predictions!

### Website Andrei Sandor (Fall 2023)

Tools:
- Vue.js
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Created alone a website showcasing main highlights of my professional and personal career. This website is composed of main tabs redirecting to diffrent links. The first tab is the main tab. This tab contains a picture of me and a quick introduction about myself. Then, the next tab is about the schools that I have went. Furthermore, there is an experience tab where I showcase my professional internship experience so far. Then, the next tab is an elegant high-level view of the main projects that I have worked so far on. The next tab is about tutoring oportunities that I offer. This tab is a form that further tutee complete where I collect all the relevent information so that I can help them. Finally, the last tab is about important links related to me.

To create this website that runs locally on machine in localhost:5174, I used all my frontend experience from my three years of high-school programming. I applied all my HTML knowledge basing around div and advanced objects in HTML (input boxes, drop-down lists, calendar input, number and string inputs,checkboxes, lists, links, pictures). Then, to make everything look good, I applied the CSS by touching a variety of features that I know (position, margin, width, height, top,left,bottom,right, padding, text-align, box, background-color) to customize in a simple and efficient way to produce an elegent view without super advance framework. Finally, for the tutoring form, I included some JavaScript to make it more interesting. Also, I used all my school experience related to frontend from courses like ECSE 321 (Intro to Software Engineering) and ECSE 428 (Software Engineering Practice). I applied the Vue.js to create a nice header for each file. I was working around views and router. I included all my HTML, CSS and JS into view files. I also organized the website by creating the tabs and the overall structure.

### 4InARowPython (August 2022)
- Created the classical four in a row game.
- Created an easy to use command-line game.

Tools:
- Python
- PyCharm
- Command-Line Programming

Created a Python command line program of a 4 in a row game. This game is made for 2 players. At each turn, a player is asked to which colmnn he wishes to insert its token. Player 1 will have a token 'X' and Player two will have a token '0'. When, the user will decide the column, the current state of the board.table will be shown. The table will be shown at every decision of the player. The program handles correctly the placement of the tokens. It also handles correctly out-of-bounds decisions. The game will be found in a while loop until it reaches the a case that a player has a four tokens placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. This game was optimized to be the most elegent possible in the code while producing rigurous results. The game is broken in many functions to make the game more elegent and simple to understand. Useful multi-dimensional array techniques were used to make simple and efficient game. The game was optimized to be the fastest by using the power of arrays.

### Tic-Tac-Toe (July 2022)
- Recreated the famous tic-tac-toe game in Java.
- Built an easy to use interace with the command-line.

Tools:
- Java (JDK 19)
- Command Line
- IntelliJ IDEA

  Created a tic-tac-toe game in Java that runs on the command line. This game is interactive; there are two players. The turn of each player will alternate until someone one or there is a draw. At this point, the game will restart. At each turn, the player will see the current state of the game. The player will have a chance to input his or her symbol (X or 0) by entering a number between 0 and 8 which representes a position on the board. This alternation will happen until a player wins or there is a draw.

  For this game, the structure of the game is simple and efficient. There is a big while loop that handles the state of the game. Inside the while loop, each player will have a section. There will be an input taken and converted to a position on the board by working with the Arrays from java.util.Arrays. Then, there will be a check for a win or a draw. Then, the next player will have the same logic applied. There are also two functions that deal with win and draw for which an efficient method to work with multidimenstional arrays is used.

## Individual School Projects
### ECSE 202 (Intro to Software Development, Fall 2021)
#### Ping Pong Game
Tools:
- Java (ACM Package)
- Eclipse IDE
- Object-Oriented Programming

First indiviudal assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignment consists of creating a Ping Pong game against the computer or playing alone with the wall. This assignment was done in 4 assignemnts focusing highly to promote understanding of object-oriented programming. Handle the ball, the player paddle, the paddle of the computer, the simulation and the table of the game in different classes. Used real physics equations to make the game like in real life. The GUI (ACM Package) and the ball interactions were done. The assignment started simple with view interactions, but eventually grew more. After each assignment, graders made sure we produce quality code and comments to learn more than just the actual grade we have.


<img width="937" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 12 34 40 PM" src="https://github.com/andrei-sandor/Portfolio-Andrei-Sandor/assets/97865484/7da8cb49-9f7f-4472-88b6-45d880f8cf2a">

#### Base2Base.c
  - C (<stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h> <ctype.h>)
  - Eclipse IDE for C

Second individual assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignment consists of creating a base to base calculator; it consists of converting a number in base in [2,36] to a base in [2,36]. This programs introduced the concept of errors in input code. This assignment was done in such a way to build a program without using object-oriented techniques. We learned how to work in functions to modularized the code such that we learn to break our code efficently for further assignemnt. Again, graders gave valuable feedback to improve our coding skills.

  - Learned functions prototypes
  - Learned definitions
  - Learned global variables
  - Learned to work inside main()
  - Learned to work with strings
  - Learn basics C constructs

##### Whack-A-Mole (Using polling and interrupts concepts)

Used the ARMv9 private timer, switches, pushbuttons and HEX displays to create a 30 seconds Whack-a-Mole game. The goal is to press the good pushbutton of where the circle/mole is in 30 seconds. The mole will reappear randomnly on a display after each correct hit. At the end, the score will be deplayed. There is functionality to start/stop and restart.

#### Assignment 3
##### Game of Life 

- Basic Assembly concepts
- Drivers
- Subroutines 
- VGA Pixel Buffer
- Keyboard Inputs (arrows and movement)
- Loops
- Using the stack.
- VGA
- BL instructions
  

For the last assignemnt of ECSE 324, we had to create a Game of Life. For this assignment, we were working with drivers. We first started working to implement in assembly a driver that takes as input keyboard interrupts to perform a movmement. We also created a driver that changes the VGA output. To implement, the whole game, we have to use these drivers and break the task in smaller ones. We had to use assembly (mainly loops, stack and bl instructions) to create the grid, the squares, the movements. Finally, we performed the main game logic by using the principles of loops, working with matrices to change the shape of the input.
