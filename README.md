## Individual School Projects
### ECSE 202 (Intro to Software Development)
#### Ping Pong Game
- Java (ACM Package)
- Eclipse IDE
- Object-Oriented Programming

First indiviudal assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignment consists of creating a Ping Pong game against the computer or playing alone with the wall. This assignment was done in 4 assignemnts focusing highly to promote understanding of object-oriented programming. Handle the ball, the player paddle, the paddle of the computer, the simulation and the table of the game in different classes. Used real physics equations to make the game like in real life. The GUI and the ball interactions were done.

#### Base2Base.c
  - C (<stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h> <ctype.h>)
  - Eclipse IDE for C

Second individual assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignemnt consists of creating a base to base calculator; it consists of converting a number in base in [2,36] to a base in [2,36]. This programs introduced the concept of errors in input code.

### ECSE 324 (Computer Organization)
  - Assembly
  - C
  - ARMv7 DE1-SoC Emulator
#### Assignment 2  

##### Calculator

The program is used to a create a calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multipliaction and division on decimal numbers. The calculator works by using switches, pushbuttons and HEX displays.

  - Basic Assembly concepts
  - Working subroutines
  - Branches and BL (branch and links)
  - Loop concepts
  - Pop and Push to store variables on the stack.
  - Working by including many drivers (Problem broken in smaller steps)

##### Whack-A-Mole (Using polling and interrupts concepts)

Used the ARMv9 private timer, switches, pushbuttons and HEX displays to create a 30 seconds Whack-a-Mole game. The goal is to press the good pushbutton of where the circle/mole is in 30 seconds. The mole will reappear randomnly on a display after each correct hit. 



  - Basic Assembly concepts
  - Working subroutines
  - Branches and BL (branch and links)
  - Loop concepts

#### Assignment 3
##### Game of Life 

- Basic Assembly concepts
- Drivers
- Subroutines 
- VGA Pixel Buffer
- Keyboard Inputs (arrows and movement)
- Loops
- Using the stack.
- VGA
- BL instructions
  

For the last assignemnt of ECSE 324, we had to create a Game of Life. For this assignment, we were working with drivers. We first started working to implement in assembly a driver that takes as input keyboard interrupts to perform a movmement. We also created a driver that changes the VGA output. To implement, the whole game, we have to use these drivers and break the task in smaller ones. We had to use assembly (mainly loops, stack and bl instructions) to create the grid, the squares, the movements. Finally, we performed the main game logic by using the principles of loops, working with matrices to change the shape of the input.

  Created in a team of 6 a website (frontend/backend) for a fictual museum that has a manager, employees and visitors. This website was broken into 3 sprints. The first sprint was used to setup the backend from a non technical point of view. Then, the second sprint, we implemented the backend by using a database (postgreSQL) and JPA annotations. The backend was broken into service, DTOs and controllers. The backend was tested with Postman by using JSON files. Then, for the final sprint, we created the fontend by using Vue.js. We also learned project management techniques used in the industry like GitHub projects, issues, sprints meetings and sprint reviews.

  Created in a team of 9 a gaming website web scrapper by using AWS. This project was broken into two sprints. The first sprint was about creating the backend by using Java, Gradle, Controllers, DTOs, model, repository, service from a domain model. Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to write user stories for what we implemented by automating them with Gherkin step definitions. Then, for the second sprint, we implementent the frontend by using Vue.js (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, axios, router, store and views). Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to test the frontend. For this project, we applied software development management techniques such as sprints, backlogs, burndown charts, scrum masters, product owners, story points, sprint reviews, sprint meetings.

Created a DiveSafe application which is a software system to facilitate diving activities in the island of Atlantis. There was a domain model that was first created to respect the requirements of the administrator of the diving program. Then, this domain model was translated into UMPLE code. Domain constraints were included. For the second sprint, we implemented completely a feature of the application. A controller and Gherkin step definitions were done. For the third sprint, we continued to build the application by introducing state machines. Finally, for the last sprint, we implemented the frontend by using Javafx and CSS.

## Individual Out of School Projects
### 4InARowPython
- Python
- PyCharm
- Command-Line Programming

Created a Python command line program of a 4 in a row game. This game is made for 2 players. At each turn, a player is asked to which colmnn he wishes to insert its token. Player 1 will have a token 'X' and Player two will have a token '0'. When, the user will decide the column, the current state of the board.table will be shown. The table will be shown at every decision of the player. The program handles correctly the placement of the tokens. It also handles correctly out-of-bounds decisions. The game will be found in a while loop until it reaches the a case that a player has a four tokens placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
- Java (JDK 19)
- Command Line
- IntelliJ IDEA

  Created a tic-tac-toe game in Java that runs on the command line. This game is interactive; there are two players. The turn of each player will alternate until someone one or there is a draw. At this point, the game will restart. At each turn, the player will see the current state of the game. The player will have a chance to input his or her symbol (X or 0) by entering a number between 0 and 8 which representes a position on the board. This alternation will happen until a player wins or there is a draw.

  For this game, the structure of the game is simple. There is a big while loop that handles the state of the game. Inside the while loop, each player will have a section. There will be an input taken and converted to a position on the board. Then, there will be a check for a win or a draw. Then, the next player will have the same logic applied.

## Team Out of School Projects
### TOHacks
#### ChatMoji

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- audioop
- websockets
- asyncio

Created in a team of 4 an application that takes speach as input and convets it to text with emojis. This project was created for the TOHacks hackathon. This application was built by bracking it in many Python files. We add a file that deals with the history of the chat, that connects the input to the app, that records message, that sends messages. We had another file that deals with receiving the message. We had an algorithm that converts text to an emoji. We also had an app that connects, listens and saves the message on a specific port to use for the frontend. We added another file that connects to a server for future development on the app.

### RUHackathon
#### CureSoft
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Sklearn (LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB)
- SQlite

Created in a teams of 3 for the RUHackathon an application that takes as input medical messurements and predicts whether the person has a disease like heart diseases, diabetes and liver diseases. To predict the disease machine learning and simple Python logic was used to produce this project. This work was then integrated with a login.py file that deals with taking the inputs, calling the algorithms mentioned previously and producing the outputs. There is also a functionality to login, to logout and to use the application (enter input and have access to previous inputs/history) by using a database sqlite.
