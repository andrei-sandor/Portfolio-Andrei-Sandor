## Individual School Projects
### ECSE 202 (Intro to Software Development)
#### Ping Pong Game
- Java (ACM Package)
- Eclipse IDE
- Object-Oriented Programming

First indiviudal assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignment consists of creating a Ping Pong game against the computer or playing alone with the wall. This assignment was done in 4 assignemnts focusing highly to promote understanding of object-oriented programming. Handle the ball, the player paddle, the paddle of the computer, the simulation and the table of the game in different classes. Used real physics equations to make the game like in real life. The GUI and the ball interactions were done.

#### Base2Base.c
  - C (<stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h> <ctype.h>)
  - Eclipse IDE for C

Second individual assignment done at McGill University in Fall 2021. This assignemnt consists of creating a base to base calculator; it consists of converting a number in base in [2,36] to a base in [2,36]. This programs introduced the concept of errors in input code.

  - Learned functions prototypes
  - Learned definitions
  - Learned global variables
  - Learned to work inside main()
  - Learned to wowk with strings
  - Learn basics C constructs

### ECSE 324 (Computer Organization)
  - Assembly
  - C
  - ARMv7 DE1-SoC Emulator
#### Assignment 2  

##### Calculator

The program is used to a create a calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multipliaction and division on decimal numbers. The calculator works by using switches, pushbuttons and HEX displays.

  - Basic Assembly concepts
  - Working subroutines
  - Branches and BL (branch and links)
  - Loop concepts
  - Pop and Push to store variables on the stack.
  - Working by including many drivers (Problem broken in smaller steps)

##### Whack-A-Mole (Using polling and interrupts concepts)

Used the ARMv9 private timer, switches, pushbuttons and HEX displays to create a 30 seconds Whack-a-Mole game. The goal is to press the good pushbutton of where the circle/mole is in 30 seconds. The mole will reappear randomnly on a display after each correct hit. 

  - Basic Assembly concepts
  - Working subroutines
  - Branches and BL (branch and links)
  - Loop concepts
  - Pop and Push to store variables on the stack.
  - Working by including many drivers (Problem broken in smaller steps)
  - ISR, IRQ, CRC

## Team school projects

### ECSE 321 (Intro to Software Engineering)
#### Museum Website
  - Write requirements
  - Domain Model
  - Use Case Diagrams
  - Gradle
  - Spring
  - JPA
  - PostgreSQL
  - Java
  - DTO
  - Service
  - Controller
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Vue.js (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  - Postman
  - InteliJ
  - JSON

  Created in a team of 6 a website (frontend/backend) for a fictual museum that has a manager, employees and visitors. This website was broken into 3 sprints. The first sprint was used to setup the backend from a non technical point of view. Then, the second sprint, we implemented the backend by using a database (postgreSQL) and JPA annotations. The backend was broken into service, DTOs and controllers. The backend was tested with Postman by using JSON files. Then, for the final sprint, we created the fontend by using Vue.js. We also learned project management techniques used in the industry like GitHub projects, issues, sprints meetings and sprint reviews.

### ECSE 428 (Software Engineering Practice)
#### Web Scraper
  - GitHub issues, branches, projects and pull requests
  - Gradle
  - AWS
  - Backend (Controller, DTO, model, repository, security, service)
  - Tesing (Unit and Integration)
  - Testing (step definitions using Gherkin)
  - Java
  - Automated Acceptance Tests
  - Sprint backlog
  - Done checklist
  - Task list
  - Burndown chart
  - Sprint
  - Project Manager, Scrum master
  - Code reviews
  - Domain model
  - User Stories

  Created in a team of 9 a gaming website web scrapper by using AWS. This project was broken into two sprints. The first sprint was about creating the backend by using Java, Gradle, Controllers, DTOs, model, repository, service from a domain model. Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to write user stories for what we implemented by automating them with Gherkin step definitions. Then, for the second sprint, we implementent the frontend by using Vue.js (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, axios, router, store and views). Then, at the end of the sprint, we had to test the frontend. For this project, we applied software development management techniques such as sprints, backlogs, burndown charts, scrum masters, product owners, story points, sprint reviews, sprint meetings.

### ECSE 223 (Model-Based Programming)
#### Dive Safe Application
  - Domain model
  - Constraints
  - Java
  - Eclipse IDE
  - Controller
  - Step definitions
  - State machine
  - Transitions
  - Frontend (JavaFx, CSS)
  - Backend (View, application, controller, model and persistence)
  - UMPLE
  - Step definitions
  - User stories
  - TDD
  - MVC

Created a DiveSafe application which is a software system to facilitate diving activities in the island of Atlantis. There was a domain model that was first created to respect the requirements of the administrator of the diving program. Then, this domain model was translated into UMPLE code. Domain constraints were included. For the second sprint, we implemented completely a feature of the application. A controller and Gherkin step definitions were done. For the third sprint, we continued to build the application by introducing state machines. Finally, for the last sprint, we implemented the frontend by using Javafx and CSS.
